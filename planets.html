						<p class = "desc1"> Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a unique combination of factors that make it habitable, including a breathable atmosphere, liquid water, and a moderate climate. The planet is characterized by diverse ecosystems, including vast oceans, lush forests, and expansive deserts. Earth is also home to a rich array of species, including humans, who have had a significant impact on its environment and continue to explore and study the planet's geological, atmospheric, and biological systems.

						<p class = "title2"> Mars </p>
						<p class = "desc2">Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is a cold and desert-like world with a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Mars has been of great interest to scientists due to its potential for harboring past or present microbial life. The planet is characterized by its rusty-red color, caused by iron oxide (or rust) covering its surface. Mars also possesses prominent features such as the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the longest canyon known, Valles Marineris. Human exploration of Mars is a key focus for future space missions, as scientists continue to study its geology, climate, and the possibility of supporting human colonization.</b>

Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant with a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere. It is known for its distinct bands of clouds and the iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and a large number of moons, including the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Its immense size and gravitational influence have a significant impact on the dynamics of the solar system. Scientists continue to study Jupiter to understand its composition, weather patterns, and its role in shaping the formation and evolution of our solar system.</b>
