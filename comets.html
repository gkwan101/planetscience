						<p class = "desc2">Halley's Comet is a famous periodic comet that orbits the Sun approximately once every 76 years. It is named after the English astronomer Edmond Halley, who predicted its return and determined its orbital period. The comet is composed of rock, dust, ice, and organic compounds. When it approaches the Sun, heat causes the ice to vaporize, creating a glowing coma and a beautiful tail that can stretch for millions of kilometers.</b>

						<p class = "title"> Meteors </p>
						<p class = "desc1">Meteors, also known as shooting stars, are celestial objects that enter the Earth's atmosphere from space. Like comets, they originate from the debris left behind by the formation of the solar system. However, unlike comets, meteors are typically small fragments of rock or metal that burn up upon atmospheric entry, creating a streak of light in the sky. Occasionally, larger meteors, called meteoroids, survive the atmospheric passage and impact the Earth's surface, creating impact craters.</b>
